                <h2>Assignment description</h2>
                <p>To create a blog site using headless WordPress to store and update the content.</p>
                <h2 class="margin-top">Changes</h2>
                <p>The feedback I got on this submission was mainly technical issues, like not closing tags, using the @font-face rule wrong etc. As I got the feedback two days before due date I fixed what I had time for, in addition to adding a search bar.</p>
                <h3 class="margin-top">Search bar</h3>
                <p>In the last submission I fetched the different categories from the WordPress API to filter content. It's always useful to have the option to search, so I decided to try to make one. </p>
                <p>I was not sure how to go about it, so I used <a class="link" href="https://www.jamesqquick.com/blog/build-a-javascript-search-bar" target="_blank">this</a> tutorial to get an idea on how to do it.
                    With the help of this I was able to make the searchbar functional using the keyup event to see if the search string matches any of the posts title, excerpt or content. </p>
                <p>As of now results come up as you type. Because users should not be responsible to clear inputs themselves, I made a function to do this when you close the searchbar, so if you open it again you have a clean slate.</p>
                <h3 class="margin-top">Other minor improvements</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The logo links to the home page and I hadn't set a width on it. This resulted in that the entire header width from the logo to the search and menu icons linked to the index page,
                        making it easy to click the link when you were really trying to open the menu. I fixed this by setting a width to the a tag.</li>
                    <li>Changed the font size and padding on the overlay text in the carousel slider.</li>
                    <li>Added @import rule to secondary style sheet, alt descriptions to the logo and instagram icon in the footer, closed the blog link in the nav.</li>
                </ul>
