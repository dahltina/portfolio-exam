                <h2>Assignment description</h2>
                <p>An online shop selling men's and women's rain jackets. They are designed for a range of different outdoor activities such as hiking.
                    The target audience are men and women aged 30 to 50 whose interests are: being outdoors, hiking, exploring, skiing, camping, canoeing.
                    The jackets are mid-range in price and emphasize durability and being suitable for a range of different weather types ensuring customers
                    are comfortable whatever adventure they go on.
                </p>
                <h2 class="margin-top">Changes</h2>
                <p>Except from the positive, I got feedback on the last submission of this project that the
                    cart was in need of more functionality, because it didn't progress after the first step.</p>
                <p>When opening the project again this time the add to cart function (that targets a dynamically
                    created button) had stopped working, without me changing anything. I asked for help from a tutor,
                    and while he neither could figure out why, he suggested that I use setTimeout to wait two or three
                    seconds for the API to finish fetching, or manage the addToCart function inside the try{} block.</p>
                <p>The buttons still came out as null, so I decided to hard code them in stead.
                    For now I think this solution works, but as mentioned in the Project Exam 1 report
                    I had similar issues with that project, so I will have to look more into it during summer break.</p>
                <p>After fixing the buttons I continued working on the checkout process. The login form and address form are not active yet,
                    but I created a page for each of the steps in the checkout process, so you can click the continue button to progress. </p>
                <h3 class="margin-top">Other minor improvements</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fixed breadcrumb categories that used to say and link to the mens jackets page disregarding if it was a woman's jacket or which page the user was coming from.</li>
                    <li>Removed some unnecessary divs that wrapped for instance the like icon.</li>
                    <li>Fixed the image width on the index page. I had set them to a max width and height that resulted in that the whole main content had an inconsistent width.</li>
                    <li>Added dynamic page title to product page.</li>
                    <li>Added transition to buttons and changed the color on hover. It was previously a lighter shade of orange, but I felt like that color didn't have a place there, so I changed it to the main blue color of the site.</li>
                    <li>Cleaned up a bit and deleted unused images.</li>
                </ul>
